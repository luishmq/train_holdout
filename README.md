# Hold Out
## Here, i'm training 2 kinds of holdout method
### The first, only with train and test data. The second, with train, test and validation data. At the end of second type, i compared the test result with the production result and i concluded that, in fact, both are similar
### Holdout with train, test and validation avoids data leakage errors
